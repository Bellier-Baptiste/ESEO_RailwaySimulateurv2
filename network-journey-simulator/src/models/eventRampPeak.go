EventRampPeak is the structure that manage the event of a peak of
ramp.

Attributes :
  - start time.Time : the start time of the event
  - end time.Time : the end time of the event
  - peak time.Time : the time of the peak
  - idStation int : the id of the station concerned by the peak
  - size int : the size of the peak
  - finished bool : true if the event is finished, false otherwise

Methods :
  - Finished() bool : return true if the event is finished, false otherwise
  - SetFinished(f bool) : set the finished attribute to f
  - Time() time.Time : return the time of the peak
  - IdStation() int : return the id of the station concerned by the peak
  - SetIdStation(id int) : set the id of the station concerned by the peak
  - Size() int : return the size of the peak
  - SetSize(s int) : set the size of the peak
